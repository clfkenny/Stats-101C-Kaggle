* What we've tried ...
*** Data Preprocessing
***** *Used training and validation set to perform classification (LR, LDA, QDA, KNN) based on dummy variables of:*
****** SubjectRace (removed 'U' observations)
******* Not much improvement over guessing 'N'
****** SubjectRace + SubjectGender (removed 'N/A' and 'U' observations)
******* Not much improvement ...
****** SubjectRace + SubjectGender + NumberOfOfficers (replaced NA with 1)
******* Not much improvement ...
***** 
*** *Looked at FullNarratives for keywords associated with fatalities and found the indexes with those keywords to change prediction to fatality after using the /Just Say No/ method*


** using missForest to impute without labels leads to bad results, that's why been getting bad results when trying to impute the test data

* Submission History
**** /5.19.20/
***** Submission 1: 0.67619 
****** Implemented 'Just Say No' Method  
***** Submission 2: 0.79761
****** Implemented 'Just Say No' Method and also converted 180 "fatal" indexes rows (from looking at FullNarratives for keywords associated with higher fatalities) to "yes" 
***** Submission 3: 0.8
****** Like above, but after a more thorough inspection of some indexes, removed some false positive "fatal" indexes
